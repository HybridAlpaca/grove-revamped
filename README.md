### V2.0

The Grove is an online RPG that you can play right in your browser.  Inspired by such great single-player RPG's such as Skyrim, we strive to produce games that anyone can play, anywhere, anytime.  Here are some of the technologies it uses:

General
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- WebGL

Frontend
- three.js
- cannon.js
- jquery
- ECMAScript 6+
- WebPack

Backend
- node.js
- MongoDB


Check out the production version of the game [here](https://revamped.grove-mmo.com)!

Or, if you're feeling extra zesty today, try out the [developmental version](https://grove-revamped-tramans.c9users.io) (expect lots of bugs and it may not always be online)
